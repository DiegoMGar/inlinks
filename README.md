## FOR 3DIDS

This program, in **python3**, will allow to group the anchors and alt texts from resource to know if there are any duplicated.

Taking as input a csv file, make sure that the first row has 'alt text' or/and 'anchor' columns, and a 'destination' one to compare.

It takes too, if exists, the 'status' and 'code' to fill more information about your data.

### RUN THE PROGRAM
Easy peasy:
```
python3 main.py inputfile outputfile
```
