## FOR 3DIDS

This program, in **python3**, will allow to group the anchors and alt texts from resource to know if there are any duplicated.

Taking as input a csv file, make sure that the first row has 'alt text' or/and 'anchor' columns, and a 'destination' one to compare.

It takes too, if exists, the 'status' and 'code' to fill more information about your data.

### RUN THE PROGRAM
Easy peasy:
```
python3 main.py inputfile
```

The output will be in the html folder, named **index.html**. Sorted by duplicated dest for each anchor, with collapse by bootstrap.
